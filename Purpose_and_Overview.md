## **Real-World Use Case Example**

### **Scenario: Harvest Season Corn Shipment**

1. **Customer (Grain Elevator)** logs into portal and creates shipment request:
   - 50,000 lbs of corn from rural Iowa farm to processing plant
   - Requires Hopper Bottom trailer
   - Pickup date during harvest season

2. **Dispatcher** receives request and posts to load board:
   - Reviews customer requirements
   - Sets appropriate rate based on tonnage and distance
   - Makes load available to qualified carriers

3. **Carrier** sees load on carrier portal:
   - Reviews load details and rate
   - Places bid if interested
   - Receives rate confirmation when accepted

4. **Driver** gets assignment on mobile dashboard:
   - Sees pickup/delivery details
   - Communicates with dispatch about timing
   - Uploads POD after delivery

5. **System handles billing**:
   - Generates invoice based on delivered tonnage
   - Tracks payment status
   - Provides financial reporting

This entire process is digitized, tracked, and documented within BulkFlow TMS, replacing phone calls, spreadsheets, and paper forms.
